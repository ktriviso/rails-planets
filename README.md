# RAILS PLANETS!!!

In this lab you'll be making a little baby rails app about PLANETS!!!! 

[Here is your planet object!](./planets.rb). Consider setting it as an instance variable in the controller. If you remember Ruby classes then you can use **def initialize** to initialize variables.

You'll be creating a bunch of routes & views using this object!

- `/`: Should have a welcome message and a link to the planets page
- `/planets`: Has a list of all the planets! (Don't hardcode this list! Just use the object. 
- `/planets/:planet`: Returns information about that specific planet
- `/planets/random`: Returns a random planet

### Bonus!!

- Style it up! Try styling them like you would one of your projects in your portfolio.

## ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

- You have a Rails app in this repo
    - **REMEMBER**: Initialize your rails app using `rails new -G planets`.
- Your rails app has the routes & views described above.
